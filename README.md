# ProjectApollo
This Github repository contains Designs/docs/software/PCB for Project Apollo (open source oxygen concentrator)

## Apollo v2 build instructions
- https://github.com/oxycon/ProjectApollo/blob/master/prototypes/Apollo%20v2/docs/Building%20instructions%20-%20prototype%20v2.pdf 

## Why
- Ventilators need oxygen! (typical FiO2 0.4 â€¦ 0.9)
- Oxygen generation is a big problem in developing countries. 
  - No established infrastructure. 
  - Oxygen bottles are expensive
- People are already looking at alternative (local) ways for producing oxygen
## What 
- Goal of the Apollo prototype = enabling people around the world to build the prototype as fast as possible
- Focus = Simplicity and speed of build 
- Final goal = Enable people to iterate and publish their own designs in the community
## How
- Follow the published build documentation
- Buy/source the materials (check out the BOM)
- Build the prototype
- Validate O2 concentration and flow. Use a good O2 and flow sensor. 
- Think about risk analysis and assessment: template for Apollo-derived design
- Document and iterate your own design. Publish your findings to the community! 

## Target 
- Output medical grade Oxygen ideally at 93% 
- Flow rate of 1-20 liters per minute (5 l/m being standard for oxygen therapy)

## Building instructions (prototype v2)
- Achieves O2 concentration out of the box: around 45% @ 5 liters/min (enough for less-critical ventilator use cases)
- Instructables-style (step-by-step) build instructions: https://github.com/oxycon/ProjectApollo/blob/master/prototypes/Apollo%20v2/docs/Building%20instructions%20-%20prototype%20v2.pdf
